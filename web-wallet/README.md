Nebulas wallet for the web. Nebulas users can use it to send transactions and submit smart contracts.

Nebulas already has a JavaScript library [neb.js](https://github.com/nebulasio/neb.js) that implements address generation, transaction signing, and submission. Web-wallet implemented using this library.

### Feature list

- generate nebulas address/keystore;
- send transaction;
- send offine transaction;
- view address/keystore info;
- view transaction status & info;
- deploy/call smart contract;
- choose nebulas network(Mainnet, Testnet etc.).

### TODO list
- Multiple wallet address import methods.
- Send transaction (NRC20) [send NAS has done.]


Thanks to @luoman for implementing a pre-version [naswallet](https://github.com/nebulasio/explorer/tree/master/nasWallet) for us.
